It’s the final countdown…? Wait… NO it is NOT! This release is just the start of something new.

Even if we can proudly ship the deluxe karaoke solution which has never been so stable before
for any operating system today, this is just a brand new start for something even bigger and better.

You guys are still havin’ a bunch of ideas which has not been merged or even implemented yet,
so this project will grow. We hopefully can release next final sooner than this one.
No – let’s not say “hopefully”. We DEFINITLY will release next final sooner, sooner than you
might expect it.
