state of your favorite karaoke game.

[Many improvements were made since our previous versions][changelog]:

*  Platform independent (Mac, Linux, Windows)
*  Visualisations with projectM
*  Mouse and unicode support
*  Video preview
*  Background videos and music in the GUI
*  Microphone configuration assistance
*  And many more other enhancements…

This is the last step before introducing the final 1.1 version, continuing the development and
revealing our plans for future versions of ultrastar deluxe. Help us on our last step.

## Due to massive changes in our game we need to update…
__…[Translations][repo-langs]__: Some translations are incomplete, so please help us to complete them!  
If there is a “ToDo” marker in a language file, we would love you for translating those sections and pass
us your result. You could even do new translations if your language is not yet available. If you got any
question, do not hesitate: Just see “Get Help!” for different ways to contact us.

## More content, even prettier
Go ahead and see what the new skin system is able to do, play around with the new party mode and the
lua plugins. You will soon be able to create your own game content which we would like you to share with
everyone from our community and maybe even include your own theme or plugin in our next release. Still there
are also [many unknown artists][jamendo] out there, help them to find their way into our game and create
some free songs for UltraStar Deluxe!
