Public beta, codenamed ‘Vocaluxe’, was just [launched yesterday][beta-launch]. Today you can
refresh your beta with a skin called ‘Verdure’ (beta) designed by MezzoX.

## Skin: Verdure (beta) by MezzoX

![Theme Verdure: Song Selection]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/theme_verdure.png %})

How to install the skin? Just extract the rar archive e.g. with [7zip][7zip], to your “themes” subfolder
within the installation directory of public beta, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Ultra Star Deluxe\themes` in
Windows or `~/Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe/themes` on Mac and `/usr/share/ultrastardx/themes`
on Ubuntu (10.04) systems.

## Test: Public Beta ‘Vocaluxe’

We already received many comments on the public beta. Please keep in mind that the main target of this
beta is to to make the code as stable as possible. Therefore we need your help for fixing errors and bugs
in it. We know you all are waiting for even more deluxe features but this is not the goal for ‘Vocaluxe’,
so please do not send in feature requests, because we know most of them already. It’s more helpful to
inform us about problems with stability and other weird behaviour of public beta.

__We offer two extra sections for the public beta__:

*  ~~[English forum][forum-en]~~
*  [German forum][forum-de]
