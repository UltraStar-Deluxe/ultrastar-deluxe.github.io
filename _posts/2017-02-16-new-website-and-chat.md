Hey everyone, we are currently preparing to switch our website from sourceforge to [github.io](https://github.io) and
then make everythig at least 20% cooler. You will be able to find the source code of our website at
[UltraStar-Deluxe/ultrastar-deluxe.github.io][usdx-website-repo] once we are finished. On a side note, we also moved
our IRC channel from Quakenet to `#usdx` @ [Freenode][freenode-webchat].

[freenode-webchat]: http://webchat.freenode.net/?nick=usdx.&channels=%23usdx&prompt=1
