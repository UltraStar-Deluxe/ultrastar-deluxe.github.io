Version 2023.6.0 has been released.
Downloads are available from [github](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX/releases/tag/v2023.6.0)
and [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/eu.usdx.UltraStarDeluxe).

## Breaking changes
The Windows version of USDX no longer ships with DLLs for OpenSSL and cURL.
Highscore plugins that rely on them should be bundled with them instead (place the plugin DLL in `webs`, the other DLLs in the main game directory).
Although copying them over from a previous USDX version will work, it is recommended to find newer versions of the libraries the plugin depends on.

## Features
* Song videos and background images now default to letterbox on game startup. Toggle with `A`. Stretch has been completely removed #689 #692\
**If you use a custom theme** (or create them) you will probably want to find `SingBackground]` in your theme ini and set `ColR=0`, `ColB=0` and `ColG=0`.
