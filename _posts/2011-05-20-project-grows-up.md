## New Release
Also a new release is planned for later this year but features are not yet decided. There
are many tasks to do for the next major release. All content needs to be and will be updated
and verified. The aim is to create the most helpful qualitative content for beginners. If you
want to help us in any way, don’t hesitate to contact us. We always need creative people who
produce content, songs, tutorials, skins, languages and many many other things. If you love to
create web designs, we could need your help, too, so that developers can focus on the tasks which
is most important: Developing.
