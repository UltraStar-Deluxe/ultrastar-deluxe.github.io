Ever wanted to play UltraStar on your smartphone? Look no further!

__UltraStar Play__ is a redevelopment of the UltraStar game using the Unity engine. This allows to build it not only for desktop platforms but also for Android and iOS.

The game is already fun to play, although not yet as feature complete as UltraStar Deluxe.

On the other hand, UltraStar Play offers some unique features, for example easy smartphone connection and a rich song editor with drag'n'drop editing.

You can download a [pre-release on GitHub](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/releases/latest).

[Setup instructions](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki/First-Steps) and [known issues](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki/Known-Issues) can be found in the [project's wiki](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki).

Have fun playing UltraStar!
