__A white and merry christmas from Fluffy and the Developer team!__

![Fluffy wishes you a merry christmas!]({{ '/images/6th_December.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Again another year draws to a close. A lot of stuff happened and changed in
universe but there is one thing which still (after all those years) remains
the same: The tiny traditional christmas poem on our website.

Donâ€™t forget to open your presents on christmas eve,
x-mas and the boxing day! ;)
