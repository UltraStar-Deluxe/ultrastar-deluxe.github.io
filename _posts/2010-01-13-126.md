__Too late? Contest closed?__ Then we got some good news for you. We received many
mails from you asking us to extend the contest due to the reason that partys have to
be planned and organized which takes more time than we thought.

We also got some mails asking what the 2nd and 3rd prize is and if there is another way
to participate in the contest cause they are not able to record and direct a movie or photostory.

So we reconsidered that proposal at our developers table and we decided: This year will be and already
is the Creative Year, so we allow a third option now (all previous works will of course stay in the contest!)

__The contest will be extended till the 28th of February!__

We also released a ChallengeMod based upon the current stable 1.0.1a!

Get your friends around, __direct a movie__, create a great individual
__photo story__ of your UltraStar Deluxe party OR __tell us why you__ of all
people really __need those fantastic wireless mics__ (more details at link below).

You can still win a brand new package containing (among with some secret things) the new
[Sony Singstar Wireless Microphones][singstar-mics] by courtesy of [Mindfactory.de AG][mf].

If you cannot wait, you could buy the excellent wireless microphones
directly from our gorgeous contest sponsor: [mindfactory.de][mf]
