Version 2023.11.0 has been released.
Downloads are available from [github](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX/releases/tag/v2023.11.0)
and [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/eu.usdx.UltraStarDeluxe).

## Enhancements
* The keyboard shortcut `S` has improved seeking to the beginning of the lyrics, and can also skip long instrumental breaks #745

## Breaking changes
In 2- and 3-player mode, certain theme elements for player 1 will no longer fallback to 1-player mode. The theme elements ending in `Static`, `Avatar`, `Text`, `Static2` and `TextScore` must now be explicitly defined. This was always the case for the `SingBar` and `Oscilloscope` elements. Very old custom themes might need to be updated to reflect this.

Experimental voice removal and its keyboard shortcut `K` have been removed.

## Other Changes
* Also update version number for Mac releases #745 #755
* Less errors (that aren't actually errors) are logged in Error.log #751
* Remove `K` experimental voice removal #754
* Code deduplication in theme loading #760
