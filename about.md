UltraStar Deluxe is a free OpenSource karaoke game for your PC. The gameplay experience is similar to
that of the commercial product SingStar™ by Sony Computer Entertainment, which is exclusively available
for the Playstation®. Unlike SingStar™, however, UltraStar Deluxe allows users to create their own songs
and sing them on their PC.

By publishing the sourcecode, we’ve enabled you to customize the game completly to your heart’s content,
desires and particular needs. Especially you are allowed to modify the product as you wish.

Create your own themes or download content from the community, such as plugins, free songs or code patches
for extended features.

In party mode it allows up to twelve players to sing along to your favorite music in order to score points,
depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing.

For UltraStar Deluxe to work you do not even have to buy expensive DVDs with not so many songs you really like,
instead just buy DRM free audio files or use your album/cd music you already own and are stored on your personal computer.

Just try it. Completly free with more than 10.000+ songs already available.

Get started reading our [documentation][readme] or directly [download the game][downloads].
Use your microphones (even SingStar™ microphones will work flawlessly) and start singing.

And welcome home as part of our community and the deluxe Ultrastar universe.
